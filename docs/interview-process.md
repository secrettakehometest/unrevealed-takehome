### Final Outcome (November 14, 2025) {#final-outcome-november-14-2025}

**November 14, 2025 - Stephanie to Mark:**
> Hi Mark,
> 
> I wanted to follow up following your interview with Brian and Kyle this week. After much consideration, at this time we have decided to move forward with other candidates. We both appreciate the time you took to speak with each of us and wish you the best. 
> 
> Regards,
> Stephanie
> People and Talent Operations Lead

**November 14, 2025 - Mark to Stephanie:**
> Hi Stephanie,
> 
> Thank you for letting me know.
> 
> I'll be direct: this interview process has been unexpectedly clarifying for me as well. After thirty years in this industry: building and shipping production systems, contributing to widely‑used open source frameworks, and maintaining a public professional presence. I've come to expect interview formats that respect the experience of senior engineers.
> 
> The live‑coding portion of this process did not meet that bar. In the freelance and consulting world, that type of work is functionally discovery, and discovery is never unpaid. Between the technical exercise, the take‑home, and the earlier calls, I spent several hours that, in any other context, would be treated as billable. Instead, I found myself performing edits under observation, as though that were a meaningful representation of my capabilities. It wasn't productive for me, and I doubt it offered you much real insight either.
> 
> This experience has made a few things clear. Going forward, I'll be declining any interviews that rely on live pairing, leet‑style exercises, or take‑home coding tests for senior roles. My open‑source work, published projects, and leadership history offer a far better picture of what I bring to a team than watching me adjust hard‑coded values in a contrived environment.
> 
> I appreciate the time your team invested, and I hope you find the candidate who fits what you're looking for. This process has at least helped me refine what I'm willing to entertain in the future.
> 
> Best regards,
> Candidate

**Them [0:30]:** Kind of just hop into it.

**Them [0:32]:** Since we're a little late.

**Them [0:38]:** So start with the intros, and then I'll just kind of go through some.

**Them [0:42]:** Of the things on your resume and ask you a few questions.

**Them [0:46]:** So. My name is Brian. I'm the lead for the business unit.

**Them [0:51]:** For? It's called human systems, which is basically all our biometrics and.

**Them [0:53]:** Products that deal with.

**Them [1:00]:** Human data. So people, those types of things, they're biometric information, and then also.

**Them [1:04]:** Different things about the people that are in the military.

**Them [1:15]:** So our core product right now is Identify, which is a mobile app. It's 100% offline, but we're trying to get it into a position to where we can.

**Them [1:29]:** Sell it to customers who are going to have different set of requirements, and those requirements are going to be some sort of connectivity because they'll be working in a different environment than our other customers that are buying the product.

**Them [1:35]:** So that's kind of where we're trying to get to, is taking our offline product online.

**Them [1:42]:** And then also building out a back end experience where it talks to different government systems. But also we have a web based hub.

**Them [1:46]:** So that data is viewable.

**Them [1:48]:** Outside of a mobile device.

**Them [1:52]:** The team right now is.

**Them [1:57]:** For Android developers myself and then one full stack engineer.

**Them [2:01]:** We're ruby on rails. Back end.

**Them [2:06]:** Front end. We're using Angular right now, so we're working on a PoC application.

**Them [2:14]:** That may or may not get picked up as a full product, but we're kind of using that as.

**Them [2:23]:** a baseline to see what did we learn what do we want to do in the future for those full on human systems hub because it's kind of a one off r and d

**Them [2:26]:** project so angular may not be the front end of the future

**Them [2:35]:** Could be something like composed multi platform since we already have a lot of Android code that can be reused.

**Them [2:38]:** That's still kind of tbd.

**Them [2:43]:** So that's kind of the current state head chief for your background.

**Them [3:55]:** I see that you have.

**Them [4:01]:** Like things like ATAC or cops. Messages on your resume. What have you used those for?

**Them [4:23]:** Okay?

**Them [4:26]:** What's your typical step look like?

**Them [5:15]:** We did. Already completed.

**Them [5:17]:** From django onto ruby.

**Them [5:20]:** Inversion. So that's kind of where we're at.

**Them [5:24]:** So can you kind of explain to me?

**Them [5:25]:** Then.

**Them [5:29]:** So what is the ksr social do?

**Them [7:14]:** I think.

**Them [7:19]:** That section on your resume is probably the one that's kind of messed up because.

**Them [7:23]:** It's talking a lot about.

**Them [7:25]:** Act servers.

**Them [7:29]:** So can you talk a little about.

**Them [7:33]:** Your experience with Docker and Kubernetes and how you use that.

**Them [8:36]:** Where were you deploying it?

**Them [8:36]:** To.

**Them [9:01]:** Okay?

**Them [9:03]:** Terraform at all.

**Them [9:14]:** So.

**Them [9:20]:** Kind of API frameworks do you like to use? Rests or graphql.

**Them [9:56]:** What languages were you writing the microservices in?

**Them [10:27]:** Are you familiar with Java and JVM based languages?

**Them [10:42]:** So what's your thought process when you have to design an API?

**Them [10:51]:** Or set up APIs specifically for us, the mobile app is going to have to have APIs designed for it.

**Them [10:57]:** How would you structure those? Go about getting the requirements, that kind of thing?

**Them [13:00]:** Which cloud databases have you worked with? And then also.

**Them [13:04]:** Work kind of security standards.

**Them [13:08]:** Have you encountered in the past that you've had to fedramp type of things?

**Them [13:10]:** To overcome.

**Them [15:09]:** With some of their systems and other agency systems.

**Them [15:12]:** Or is it all kind of isolated?

**Them [15:41]:** Okay?

**Them [15:49]:** Sounds like you have a lot of experience with LLMs.

**Them [16:11]:** And then.

**Them [16:15]:** How do you handle code reviews and mentoring more junior developers?

**Them [17:45]:** So what's kind of attracting you to reveal.

**Them [17:48]:** What are you kind of looking for in your next position?

**Them [18:18]:** Okay?

**Them [18:21]:** Yeah.

**Them [18:28]:** So a little bit about that is so like our team. There's three real teams at this point.

**Them [18:33]:** It's a far side product, which is the drones.

**Them [18:36]:** Mostly what that is is.

**Them [18:40]:** It's software that goes onto drones, so it's not the actual drone.

**Them [18:42]:** And then.

**Them [18:44]:** There's another group.

**Them [18:50]:** They're called C2AI, but they're not doing any AI quite yet. What they're doing.

**Them [18:58]:** Is kind of similar in a way to what our team's doing. It's building an application that's going to replace something.

**Them [19:04]:** I think it's mostly DoD based, but it's going to replace some sort of training system.

**Them [19:12]:** And then what our team is doing is, like I mentioned, all the human based products are on the personnel.

**Them [19:15]:** And we're also building a cloud based.

**Them [19:20]:** Cloud based product. We can't say it's really going to be cloud based.

**Them [19:25]:** Because most that we're doing now is just installing Docker containers on laptops because it needs to be isolated.

**Them [19:33]:** So AI room for growth is.

**Them [19:45]:** I guess you can't know what the titles here kind of messed up. But again, I call them our product lead. The person who's kind of like the ideas guy, wants to get some AI involved.

**Them [19:52]:** Where are people? How do we move resources? All those types of things that's all kind of like on the horizon.

**Them [20:04]:** But in order to get there, we have to first get the data, which requires that we have product built that's installed and then have them basically enter data, or we suck it in through some other mechanism.

**Them [20:06]:** Which is kind of why I was asked in a.

**Them [20:10]:** Few connected to government systems before is I feel like.

**Them [20:22]:** That's probably going to be something we're going to do in the near future, is get access to whatever their product is now and then start some sort of ETL process to get that into format that we consume.

**Them [20:24]:** Because we already kind of have that.

**Them [20:32]:** Mobile. We'll need that for our hub database as well.

**Them [20:34]:** So yeah.

**Them [20:39]:** We got about 5ish minutes left, so if you want to ask some questions, feel free.

**Them [20:45]:** Yeah.

**Them [20:47]:** I've been here.

**Them [20:49]:** For almost nine months now.

**Them [20:54]:** My background is from big tech companies.

**Them [20:58]:** So it's quite a bit different than that, but I wanted to get back into a startup.

**Them [21:02]:** So startup I was at went through a series of acquisitions.

**Them [21:07]:** Wound up at Cisco, which is massive.

**Them [21:14]:** So I was just kind of done with that. So I made it through multiple runs of acquisitions, and I was like, I need to go to it again.

**Them [21:16]:** That's kind of how I wound up here.

**Them [21:53]:** It's kind of.

**Them [22:04]:** The guiding principles of this company is that they purge the calendars quite often.

**Them [22:11]:** So really, there's two meetings, the two standing meetings that you would be in.

**Them [22:12]:** That's it for the week.

**Them [22:15]:** The rest of it. Heads down. Coding.

**Them [22:17]:** Solving problems.

**Them [22:22]:** Kind of the brunt of the meeting.

**Them [22:32]:** Fall on me, kind of interacting with the different people, and then we can kind of translate as a group and the two sync meetings we have, but then the rest of it is just.

**Them [22:34]:** Getting things done.

**Them [22:36]:** Which is kind of.

**Them [22:36]:** Nice.

**Them [23:31]:** Switches and stuff like that.

**Them [23:34]:** Even me.

**Them [23:36]:** I have seven direct reports.

**Them [23:40]:** Still don't have near as many meetings as I had.

**Them [23:41]:** At big companies.

**Them [23:43]:** I didn't do really any coding.

**Them [23:46]:** Now I do at least about half time coding.

**Them [23:47]:** Which is nice.

**Them [24:06]:** Probably. I think the direction that our team is going sounds like it might be right up your alley.

**Them [24:09]:** Some problems we're trying to solve.

**Them [24:12]:** Are ones that have not been solved yet.

**Them [24:18]:** So that's always an interesting problem to work on.

**Them [24:22]:** It's kind of cool to do the R and D stuff because.

**Them [24:26]:** We get to. Basically, we're making our mistakes without having anyone to really.

**Them [24:37]:** Please. We get to make these mistakes, but then we know that those mistakes will inform how we build the true product that we're going to start building here in.

**Them [24:39]:** The next. Probably January sometime.

**Them [24:45]:** All right.

**Them [25:02]:** That is another cool project. We.

**Them [25:07]:** Might spend a lot of talk about in the news of autonomous vehicles and things like that.

**Them [25:10]:** And having biometrics.

**Them [25:14]:** On things like that so that it can send out a drawer and figure out who are these people.

**Them [25:15]:** That are in this area.

**Them [25:19]:** Holding a lot of stuff we can do.

**Them [25:28]:** I will let you go. I guess kind of. The next steps, though, is I've talked to Stephanie, and then.

**Them [25:30]:** She will reach out the next day or so.

**Them [25:31]:** Next steps.

**Them [25:34]:** Nice to meet you.

### Stage 2: Technical Take-Home Assessment (November 7, 2025) {#stage-2-technical-take-home-assessment-november-7-2025}
**Assigned:** November 6, 2025  
**Completed:** November 7, 2025  
**Repository:** https://github.com/candidate-username/task-manager-takehome  
**Time Spent:** ~42 minutes (initial implementation)

**Requirements:**
- Build a small full-stack application (Task Manager)
- CRUD operations (create, view, update, delete, search)
- Containerized with Docker
- Clear README with setup instructions
- Minimal local setup required

### Stage 3: Technical Review (November 12, 2025) {#stage-3-technical-review-november-12-2025}
**Interviewers:** Interviewer A (Lead Android Developer) and Interviewer B (Full Stack Engineer)  
**Duration:** 30 minutes (extended to ~45 minutes)  
**Format:** Google Meet video call with screen share  
**Time:** 4pm EST (rescheduled from 3pm EST)

#### Summary

**Action Items Identified:**
- Send interviewers the GitHub walkthrough link
- Update docker-compose.yml to declare the db_data volume explicitly
- Consolidate task status values into a shared constant/module (e.g., TaskStatuses::STATUSES)
- Add/adjust unit tests for status validation
- Prepare a short diagram showing the Docker container, SQLite DB, and front-end stack

**Key Discussion Points:**

**Background & Setup:**
- Mark and Kyle both in Dallas metroplex (Mark in Richardson, Kyle in Dallas)
- Mark runs Windows, had to reinstall Docker after system reformat
- Uses Docker to host Ruby on Rails backend with SQLite as the database
- Front-end built with Bootstrap; Docker needed because of Windows environment constraints
- Relies on Cursor (AI coding assistant) to generate unit tests, then manually sanity-checks them

**Technical Issues Identified:**

1. **Docker Volumes Issue:**
   - docker-compose.yml references db_data volume only inside the web service, not declared globally
   - Still works because Docker auto-creates an unnamed volume at runtime
   - Best practice: declare named volumes explicitly for portability and clarity

2. **Code Organization Concern:**
   - Task status values duplicated across backend and frontend files (5 locations: migration, model validation, default, forms, and view logic)
   - Suggested centralizing them in a constant or helper module

**Live Refactoring:**
- Mark live-refactored the status handling during the call
- Created a Rails enum, cleaned up references, and ran the test suite
- Fixed several manual issues live (typos, missing tags, syntax mismatches)
- Used Cursor's automation tooling to run tests and verify changes

**Interviewer Questions & Answers:**
- **Why does the volume work without explicit declaration?**  
  Docker auto-creates the volume at runtime when a path is mounted but not pre-declared.

- **How to improve status handling?**  
  Move all status definitions to a single constant/module and reference it everywhere (model, controller, front-end).

**Postmortem Reflection:**

**Technical:**
- Setup: Docker container running Rails app, code built with heavy Cursor/AI assist for initial scaffolding
- Stack choices: Used Docker, Rails, SQLite (for demo), and Bootstrap
- Volume gotcha: They zeroed in on Docker Compose's auto-created volumes—asked why the app worked without an explicit volume declaration
- Code review focus: They flagged "status" duplication, Mark acknowledged it was quick-and-dirty scaffolding (Cursor default), then live-refactored with Rails enum
- Fixed several manual issues live (typos, missing tags, syntax mismatches)—not pretty, but ultimately got it running and tested

**Communication:**
- Kept the conversation direct and transparent; didn't oversell or soft-pedal the limitations of the demo code
- Admitted to using Cursor for speed—justified as a best practice for fast, error-free scaffolding, with manual audit/refactor afterward
- Walked through Docker concepts, why containerize/not, and trade-offs in ephemeral setups
- Was honest about "how I'd do it in prod vs. demo"

**Vibe/Soft Skills:**
- Engineers were civil but not especially animated or curious; mostly just checked boxes and asked for explanations
- Energy was low and clock-watching toward the end
- The entire exercise felt like technical theater, not a real collaboration or engineering problem
- Personally: Found it draining and uninspiring—if the salary wasn't almost $200K, impulse would have probably bailed

**Reflection:**
- Can pass these—delivered everything they wanted, live-fixed what they didn't like, ran tests, and closed the loop
- The value of code tests for senior hires is pretty dubious, especially when you have public code, references, and architecture work to show

#### Full Transcript

*[See detailed transcript below - 45+ minutes of conversation covering setup, code walkthrough, Docker volumes discussion, live refactoring of status enum, and Q&A]*

**Key Moments from Transcript:**

- **1:28-3:12**: Small talk about Dallas weather and metro area size
- **3:34-4:26**: Mark's background overview (elder full-stack dev, agentic AI focus, Quasar and Sanctum OS)
- **4:43-8:17**: Technical setup discussion (Windows, Docker, SQLite, Bootstrap, Cursor for tests)
- **8:21-13:26**: Project walkthrough (Rails scaffolding, validations, CRUD operations, testing approach)
- **13:34-20:38**: Code review of validations in Task model and controller
- **20:46-23:55**: Docker volumes discussion - why it works without explicit declaration
- **24:08-27:40**: Status duplication issue identified, discussion of solutions (constants, enums)
- **27:40-44:56**: Live refactoring session - converting to Rails enum, updating all references, running tests
- **45:02-45:55**: Closing - questions, next steps (Stephanie will follow up tomorrow)

**Notable Quotes:**

- Mark on Cursor: "I'm a huge fan of letting cursor write unit tests it's it's more thorough than I'll ever be... I just sanity check it when it's done and make sure when it's writing the corrections that it's not correcting the test to get a passing grade versus correcting the code that was wrong in the first place."

- Mark on Docker: "I don't use them unless I need them I try to leave the code my microservices... it's easier to keep the user out of trouble if you put everything inside of a docker container rather than tell them to install it and use a virtual environment."

- Mark on the experience: "I don't know how exciting that was to watch... I don't know if that tells you what you need to know about me."

**Mark [1:28]:** there you go yeah it's going pretty good how about you

**Them [1:35]:** add it

**Them [1:35]:** yet

**Mark [1:37]:** in

**Them [1:37]:** texas

**Them [1:39]:** yeah i'm in texas i'm in dallas

**Them [1:44]:** peter shut off

**Them [1:46]:** because it's freezing here

**Mark [1:56]:** it was one of those weird days like i put on a hoodie when i went out for my walk today thinking it was like oh it's going to be a little chilly it's seventy five

**Them [2:00]:** so in the

**Mark [2:00]:** shade it was just right in the sun sweating

**Them [2:06]:** feet

**Them [2:09]:** so cold a lot of the year

**Them [2:18]:** we have an air conditioner but i think i've used it twice that was just a test that we bought the place right

**Them [2:23]:** we're in dallas are you located

**Mark [2:25]:** i'm on the north side richardson

**Mark [2:28]:** okay i'm not familiar with that

**Mark [2:38]:** if you're going north on seventy five which is like one of the big highways that runs the town it's the first suburb to the north it's still inside the county

**Them [2:44]:** so this is kyle he also lives in the dallas area

**Them [2:47]:** exactly sure where the dallas area

**Them [2:50]:** big metroplex

**Them [2:50]:** yeah

**Them [2:56]:** this whole thing is about the size of massachusetts i think the whole metroplex

**Them [3:01]:** i didn't even know that it's an interesting stat yeah

**Them [3:12]:** so it's just kind of hop into it it looks like stephanie just put a half hour on the calendar usually we do forty five

**Them [3:19]:** so if you can it'd be great if we could stay on a little bit if you have any questions or anything like that

**Them [3:21]:** in the interest of time

**Them [3:28]:** we'll just kind of hop into it sure so for kyle's benefit can you just kind of get him run down on your background a little bit

**Them [3:32]:** yeah

**Them [3:34]:** i'm an elder

**Them [3:41]:** full stack dev i've been around doing tech since the nineties

**Them [3:49]:** i've been spending the last couple of years focusing on agentic ai stuff with a lot of

**Them [4:11]:** well i would say two big startups one is quasar which was kind of an interesting game with some business ip that was generated off of it and then there was sanctum os which is the nonprofit that i started that kind of owns most of the ip i generate elsewhere and just kind of like an open source foundation

**Them [4:19]:** that has built a bunch of really interesting stateful agent installations for people

**Them [4:22]:** i don't know

**Them [4:26]:** sixty seconds or less on the clock what i've been up to for the last couple years

**Them [4:43]:** so generally the way we run these meetings is we'll ask you to share your screen we'll just have you run your project walk us through what you did why you did it

**Mark [4:47]:** hop in with questions as they come up

**Mark [4:58]:** and i found

**Them [4:58]:** in these interviews with google meet it's easier just to share your whole screen because for some reason if you share a window it just eats all the memory

**Mark [4:59]:** sure

**Them [5:03]:** really screws up your experience

**Mark [5:11]:** i don't usually have all these things on my desktop running so let me restart docker and everything

**Mark [5:19]:** probably should have done that before we got on a call though

**Mark [5:34]:** is it

**Mark [5:35]:** blurring

**Mark [5:41]:** no just takes a second

**Them [5:45]:** windows or linux

**Mark [5:47]:** running windows

**Mark [5:55]:** usually

**Mark [6:02]:** i honestly don't run docker instant haven't run docker instances locally in a minute so i had to reinstall it on this machine

**Mark [6:06]:** i had it on before but

**Mark [6:09]:** i had to reformat situation since then

**Mark [6:18]:** you do a lot of freelance work there's scammers out there that'll put malware in the github repos

**Mark [6:24]:** and i had too close of a call didn't feel comfortable about what may or may not have ran so i just nuke the whole machine

**Mark [6:28]:** took me like took me took like two or three days out of productivity

**Mark [6:30]:** let's see

**Mark [6:32]:** is the docker compose up

**Mark [6:43]:** do this while that's going

**Them [6:56]:** to have come across quite few people using windows machines the past couple of months and i hadn't touched windows years

**Them [7:00]:** what are people on for you mostly like mac stuff or what

**Them [7:05]:** max i've been running macs since college

**Mark [7:14]:** i like linux better but it's windows is mostly one of most familiar with

**Them [7:23]:** mean that's not the worst thing in the world because i know one of the other teams here recently

**Them [7:26]:** was told they had to do stuff on azure

**Them [7:31]:** and we do not have much windows expertise in house right now

**Them [7:35]:** quasar

**Them [7:37]:** which we did a lot of azure cloud stuff

**Mark [7:45]:** it was mostly because the engineers that we hired just wanted

**Mark [7:51]:** to i think well the dev environment was azure i think we ended up migrating it to aws after we were done though

**Mark [7:54]:** ok

**Mark [7:56]:** looks like we're up

**Them [8:07]:** cool yeah

**Them [8:15]:** so yeah let's just kind of start walking us through

**Them [8:17]:** base everything up

**Mark [8:21]:** yeah i mean it's pretty straightforward

**Mark [8:26]:** i kind of used some templates there

**Mark [8:29]:** i think

**Mark [8:35]:** i what did i choose i think i chose bootstrap and then ruby in the back end

**Mark [8:40]:** because it's a windows machine i had to use docker

**Mark [8:45]:** sqlite for the database because you know why get crazy with it

**Mark [8:52]:** i ran it through

**Mark [8:56]:** a bunch of automation testing and a bunch of you know like

**Mark [9:00]:** did i did i create unit tests for it or not yeah i think i did

**Mark [9:02]:** looking

**Them [9:05]:** at what did you use to write those unit tests

**Them [9:12]:** honestly

**Mark [9:12]:** i i'm i'm a huge fan of letting cursor write unit tests it's it's more thorough than i'll ever be

**Mark [9:17]:** and so i just make i just you know sanity check it when it's done

**Mark [9:25]:** and make sure when it's writing the corrections that it's not correcting the test to get a passing grade versus correcting the code that was wrong in the first place

**Mark [9:29]:** so that's the that's the danger of running that so yeah

**Them [9:47]:** environment is and you just kind of talk through the the docker container what you said you chose sqlite how did you build the tables that kind of stuff

**Mark [9:56]:** yeah so let me actually go back if i've slept since then but i did write documentation

**Mark [9:58]:** so

**Mark [10:00]:** i will

**Mark [10:02]:** actually i got it here in the github

**Mark [10:10]:** so i built you know what rather than just walking through the whole thing i built a little walkthrough

**Mark [10:16]:** that we can you can kind of scroll through i'll give you the link for it as well

**Mark [10:19]:** here in the little chat if you want to run it locally

**Mark [10:23]:** but

**Mark [10:26]:** where is the chat

**Them [10:31]:** i used to

**Them [10:34]:** there's like a little oh yeah yeah all right they move the buttons around

**Them [10:36]:** every every time i try to lag stuff

**Them [10:42]:** so there's like the that's the walkthrough and it's got like screenshots of everything

**Them [10:44]:** visible

**Mark [10:44]:** features

**Mark [10:47]:** like the forms are what's required what's not

**Mark [10:54]:** then the project plan so you're asking about what's in it so

**Mark [11:05]:** my time estimations weren't exactly right i was i spent a lot more time on the polish phase than i did on the

**Mark [11:08]:** front end

**Mark [11:11]:** stuff the front end stuff actually went a lot quicker

**Mark [11:24]:** but yeah so this is kind of where i buttoned up the docker container i think i built like the scaffolding for it because you know like the ruby does all the scaffolding for you kind of

**Mark [11:28]:** i think where it was yeah configurability was over here

**Mark [11:30]:** so

**Mark [11:33]:** this is where i just kind of

**Mark [11:35]:** like designed the schema

**Mark [11:43]:** scaffold everything that was like you know what it was going to be built the routes

**Mark [11:44]:** kind of like the back end

**Mark [11:49]:** well kind of transitioning in the back end

**Mark [11:54]:** this is where like i put like validations and stuff in it

**Mark [11:59]:** was like phase two but it was really like you know five minutes after phase one

**Mark [12:03]:** this is where all like the crud stuff went in

**Mark [12:08]:** like all the real functionality

**Them [12:13]:** the validations did you add or some of the things that that you thought were important

**Mark [12:18]:** let's see

**Mark [12:21]:** i've got

**Mark [12:22]:** where's that

**Mark [12:28]:** ok i've got some notes here i'm looking up

**Mark [12:35]:** so

**Mark [12:44]:** yeah this is i did so actually i did stop the test here so that was the like i stopped a test here before i went on to the next phase

**Mark [12:54]:** this is where i built some of the tests what i was validating in the back end is case insensitivity

**Mark [12:59]:** success error messages

**Mark [13:03]:** that they were rendering correctly

**Mark [13:04]:** you know to spec

**Mark [13:09]:** basic data validation

**Mark [13:12]:** which was really just you know

**Mark [13:23]:** the the you know the length and whatnot it wasn't really this is not a super complicated thing that wasn't like form type like data types to validate really

**Mark [13:24]:** so

**Mark [13:26]:** quite easy honestly

**Them [13:34]:** pretty liberal in the back end too so like it's a you know a feel is a feel for sqlite

**Them [13:40]:** you switch over to the code so we can kind of look at that and just kind of walk through sure

**Them [13:44]:** put id jews

**Mark [13:50]:** so i use cursor for pretty much everything but i i use

**Mark [13:53]:** this

**Mark [13:56]:** i don't really use the agent mode

**Mark [13:57]:** i'll be honest

**Mark [13:59]:** it's not i'm not a fan of it

**Mark [14:03]:** i use that agent mode for generating issues and that's about it

**Mark [14:11]:** so

**Mark [14:22]:** yeah i'm not sure what you want to look at exactly but

**Them [14:22]:** see where you're doing the validation

**Mark [14:23]:** sure

**Mark [14:29]:** give me one second

**Mark [14:29]:** here

**Mark [14:50]:** sorry my system's lagging

**Mark [14:55]:** closing out some other i've got three cursor windows open right now so i'm closing some out

**Mark [14:58]:** hopefully

**Mark [15:06]:** okay

**Mark [15:16]:** today anytime today

**Mark [15:23]:** sorry i've been doing this i don't know if they should remember i showed you before i'm doing this like

**Mark [15:25]:** work for this robot here

**Mark [15:30]:** so i had a bunch of stuff going in the background shutting down

**Them [15:36]:** something similar

**Them [15:38]:** to makeup farsight those things

**Them [15:40]:** yeah

**Mark [15:42]:** hopefully

**Mark [15:45]:** been working on like a copilot dashboard

**Mark [15:47]:** for it

**Mark [15:49]:** so

**Mark [15:53]:** basically you can

**Mark [16:03]:** basically you can have like your your lidar and your video up on the same screen it'll like transcribe any audio that it detects and whatnot

**Mark [16:06]:** i

**Mark [16:08]:** cannot get this i mean i've got to restart cursor real quick give me one second

**Mark [16:11]:** i just i'm just going to close all the windows

**Mark [16:14]:** i think they did an update today

**Mark [16:25]:** might be time to change the vsc for the day if there's shit sometimes their stuff's not stable

**Mark [16:56]:** now

**Mark [16:57]:** that file open folder

**Mark [18:17]:** come on

**Mark [18:18]:** why is it so slow

**Mark [18:21]:** here we go

**Mark [18:36]:** mod

**Mark [18:37]:** els

**Mark [18:38]:** where's miles

**Mark [18:45]:** god

**Mark [18:45]:** dang

**Mark [18:50]:** app

**Mark [18:51]:** models

**Mark [18:56]:** so here we go

**Mark [19:05]:** here and in task controllers which is over in controllers

**Mark [19:07]:** and

**Mark [19:11]:** let's see

**Mark [19:20]:** so in the back end validations or in the task model there is

**Mark [19:28]:** requires a title requires presence equally true for that you know for the requirement

**Mark [19:30]:** that there is something that's not nothing

**Mark [19:34]:** it validates

**Mark [19:46]:** validate status inclusion in pending in progress keep was completed restricts the status of one of the three allowed values so the drop down and then

**Mark [19:47]:** on

**Mark [19:48]:** the

**Mark [19:50]:** controller over here

**Mark [19:55]:** if task save fails

**Mark [20:00]:** on a validation error where is that that

**Mark [20:06]:** here

**Mark [20:11]:** the pattern applies in the update action

**Mark [20:12]:** on

**Mark [20:14]:** somewhere later

**Mark [20:16]:** thirty

**Mark [20:17]:** let's see

**Mark [20:18]:** right basically here

**Mark [20:20]:** in the update patch

**Mark [20:30]:** so basically the form displays the errors whenever validation fails

**Mark [20:31]:** due to these

**Them [20:38]:** any questions you want to hop into right away

**Them [20:43]:** sure

**Them [20:46]:** i want to hear

**Mark [20:54]:** i mean functionally like i'm not an engineer

**Mark [20:59]:** level with docker i understand how they work i understand where they sit in the stack

**Mark [21:10]:** basically i don't use them unless i need them i try to leave the code my microservices you know

**Mark [21:28]:** i write all the stuff with python right so it doesn't really need a docker instance but there's sometimes like this thing that i'm working on now this dashboard has really weird pin dependencies that if anybody points claude code at this thing it would it just is going to like okay well i don't

**Mark [21:38]:** want you know this version of python i want to use like you know a more recent version and so it's easier to keep the user out of trouble if you put everything inside of a docker container

**Mark [21:45]:** rather than tell them to install it and use a virtual environment with an old version of python that still works with a robot

**Them [21:52]:** docker volumes and now docker volumes work

**Them [21:55]:** yeah

**Them [21:56]:** i mean

**Mark [22:03]:** like i yeah like basically as a user i wouldn't say you know i could

**Mark [22:08]:** it's where you can persist the data in the writable layer you know

**Them [22:16]:** there's actually an issue with the app that you have latest docker volumes if you open up the docker compose file

**Them [22:23]:** db data and the volumes

**Them [22:33]:** that's actually not consistent in your code base and i was wondering if you could talk me through why it still works regardless of the fact

**Mark [22:37]:** let's see

**Mark [22:40]:** that's a great question

**Them [23:00]:** specifically i'm talking about within that volume section there in the web service

**Them [23:02]:** you have db data

**Them [23:10]:** set to the binding that directory is the

**Them [23:16]:** it's actually not consistent

**Mark [23:16]:** creating it at runtime like auto creating at runtime

**Mark [23:18]:** even though it's not declared

**Mark [23:23]:** it didn't come up as an error so i guess i didn't really test for it i was kind of speeding through this

**Them [23:35]:** could you maybe walk me through why you think it's still working in its current state

**Mark [23:46]:** i mean i guess docker still mounts the path

**Mark [23:53]:** whenever a volume isn't explicitly declared just auto creates it at runtime i guess that's i'm not sure how

**Mark [23:55]:** to go granular than that

**Them [24:08]:** defined the statuses for each task right

**Them [24:21]:** exists defined several different locations across the backend and front end uniquely within different files

**Them [24:26]:** several different ways you could improve that

**Them [24:31]:** but maybe you could throw out some ideas about how you might improve

**Them [24:35]:** the overall project structure so that you're not feeding yourself

**Mark [24:43]:** let's see

**Mark [24:44]:** well

**Them [24:48]:** you pull up in the code

**Them [24:51]:** like the first location those are defined and walk us through that

**Them [24:53]:** the location i'm sorry

**Mark [24:59]:** i'm reading the closed caption because the io is not coming out very well so what are we looking for

**Them [25:03]:** statuses of the tasks

**Mark [25:05]:** okay

**Them [25:10]:** they're defined

**Them [25:12]:** in several different locations

**Them [25:14]:** all of them

**Them [25:16]:** but i just wanted you to

**Them [25:21]:** walk me through how you might improve the app

**Them [25:26]:** to you know not have to like if you had to add more statuses

**Them [25:31]:** instead of having to update five different locations how might you go about implementing that

**Mark [25:43]:** we probably would want to define a constant in

**Mark [25:44]:** the yeah

**Mark [25:51]:** probably find a constant somewhere or not necessarily constant but at least an array of statuses and then refer to that as in the model

**Mark [25:55]:** i'm looking at all the places where it shows up you're right

**Mark [25:59]:** so there's one over in

**Mark [26:04]:** the database migrator there's one

**Mark [26:05]:** in

**Mark [26:08]:** where is that

**Mark [26:14]:** yeah that's not really necessary so then there's one over in

**Mark [26:17]:** app models

**Mark [26:18]:** is that right

**Mark [26:25]:** where is it

**Mark [26:26]:** oh

**Mark [26:28]:** and task rb

**Mark [26:32]:** yeah

**Mark [26:34]:** there's

**Mark [26:35]:** yeah

**Mark [26:37]:** there's three other locations you're right

**Them [26:42]:** in place

**Them [26:45]:** that

**Them [26:46]:** about

**Them [26:50]:** how would you pass that

**Them [26:51]:** across the app

**Mark [26:59]:** well probably there's a few ways you could do it one would be to probably

**Mark [27:03]:** just make a helper method with some constants in it

**Mark [27:05]:** let's see

**Them [27:09]:** you know of any way within to do that

**Mark [27:13]:** railsy num

**Mark [27:17]:** or a simple constant array

**Mark [27:20]:** let's see

**Mark [27:25]:** i'm looking through so yeah you could do like i mean that would be probably the easiest way to do it

**Mark [27:27]:** just create a task

**Mark [27:30]:** define the class

**Mark [27:32]:** with the status and refer to that

**Them [27:37]:** like that

**Mark [27:40]:** sure

**Them [29:28]:** alter the existing class

**Them [29:31]:** yeah no i'm just

**Mark [29:38]:** seeing

**Mark [29:39]:** what

**Mark [29:46]:** know what i could just do that

**Mark [29:47]:** hang on

**Them [31:01]:** declare those below the word private or other classes can be able to see the no i'm going to have to remove that

**Mark [32:54]:** form

**Mark [33:03]:** actually let me make sure i got everything here

**Mark [33:17]:** yeah

**Mark [33:17]:** okay

**Mark [33:18]:** form

**Mark [33:20]:** where to go

**Mark [34:01]:** stat

**Mark [34:01]:** us that's right

**Mark [34:04]:** floor select

**Mark [34:39]:** my place

**Them [34:51]:** and what exactly are you doing here

**Them [34:54]:** i'm just calling

**Them [34:57]:** the i'm calling the enum options here

**Them [35:34]:** title wise

**Mark [35:45]:** is it

**Mark [35:47]:** is that how i spelled it before

**Them [36:05]:** yeah i think that's right

**Them [36:07]:** it's not like good english though

**Mark [36:11]:** not how i'd spell it

**Mark [36:29]:** see

**Mark [36:57]:** probably need to fix it in the index

**Them [38:47]:** explain is your as you're doing things

**Mark [38:51]:** i mean this is just replacing the hard coded thing with

**Mark [38:53]:** the case statement

**Mark [38:55]:** with the helper method

**Mark [39:01]:** just trying to get my quotes correct

**Mark [39:15]:** probably should

**Mark [39:16]:** close

**Mark [39:27]:** see we need to go to task

**Mark [39:29]:** partial

**Mark [39:31]:** it's also where it shows up

**Mark [39:37]:** that's over in

**Mark [39:41]:** task html

**Mark [39:46]:** so let's kind of privy these here

**Mark [39:48]:** see i got it all

**Mark [39:54]:** twelve twenty five so i can leave that i can leave that

**Mark [39:57]:** just change the div out

**Mark [40:49]:** i got my

**Mark [40:49]:** quotes correct

**Mark [40:50]:** to make sure i'm good

**Mark [40:53]:** that's not correct

**Mark [40:58]:** and that's also incorrect

**Mark [41:07]:** that might be it

**Mark [41:12]:** see run my test

**Mark [41:57]:** i'm just running the test on it make sure i didn't leave any syntax errors in there

**Mark [42:02]:** rerunning the docker instance

**Mark [42:14]:** oh it's doing the automation test now and see if it'll show you

**Mark [42:35]:** says the status badges aren't rendering

**Mark [42:56]:** sorry restarting the docker

**Mark [43:12]:** okay

**Mark [43:13]:** here we go

**Mark [43:47]:** so

**Mark [43:50]:** okay it's verifying now

**Mark [44:05]:** how it's testing too if you're interested

**Mark [44:17]:** i usually do this on two screen situation where i let cursor run the automation tests

**Mark [44:19]:** because it's easier than writing them

**Mark [44:24]:** it just uses a vision tool to visually inspect stuff

**Mark [44:32]:** so yeah looks like it passed

**Mark [44:38]:** this is the summary of the test

**Mark [44:42]:** you're in chat

**Mark [44:46]:** so there was a couple of things that had to fix

**Mark [44:48]:** but mostly i don't know

**Mark [44:56]:** oh now actually that didn't it was just one misplaced bracket from the previous test

**Them [45:02]:** we're basically at time

**Them [45:08]:** so you want to ask a couple questions that kyle or i before we sign up

**Them [45:09]:** go ahead

**Mark [45:12]:** yeah i don't know how exciting that was to watch

**Mark [45:16]:** i don't know if that tells you what you need to know about me

**Them [45:21]:** a little bit

**Them [45:27]:** so do you have any questions or do you want to just leave it at that

**Mark [45:30]:** i mean i don't know

**Mark [45:32]:** i guess

**Mark [45:36]:** i guess i have any questions other than what we've talked about in the past couple meetings

**Them [45:39]:** all right

**Them [45:44]:** so kind of the next steps is kamau talk to stephanie

**Them [45:46]:** and then she will reach back out

**Them [45:48]:** probably sometime tomorrow

**Them [45:52]:** so it's good to good to talk to you again okay

**Them [45:52]:** sounds good

**Them [45:55]:** thank you
