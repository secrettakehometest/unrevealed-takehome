### Final Outcome (November 14, 2025)

**November 14, 2025 - Stephanie to Mark:**
> Hi Mark,
> 
> I wanted to follow up following your interview with Brian and Kyle this week. After much consideration, at this time we have decided to move forward with other candidates. We both appreciate the time you took to speak with each of us and wish you the best. 
> 
> Regards,
> Stephanie
> People and Talent Operations Lead

**November 14, 2025 - Mark to Stephanie:**
> Hi Stephanie,
> 
> Thank you for letting me know.
> 
> I'll be direct: this interview process has been unexpectedly clarifying for me as well. After thirty years in this industry: building and shipping production systems, contributing to widely‑used open source frameworks, and maintaining a public professional presence. I've come to expect interview formats that respect the experience of senior engineers.
> 
> The live‑coding portion of this process did not meet that bar. In the freelance and consulting world, that type of work is functionally discovery, and discovery is never unpaid. Between the technical exercise, the take‑home, and the earlier calls, I spent several hours that, in any other context, would be treated as billable. Instead, I found myself performing edits under observation, as though that were a meaningful representation of my capabilities. It wasn't productive for me, and I doubt it offered you much real insight either.
> 
> This experience has made a few things clear. Going forward, I'll be declining any interviews that rely on live pairing, leet‑style exercises, or take‑home coding tests for senior roles. My open‑source work, published projects, and leadership history offer a far better picture of what I bring to a team than watching me adjust hard‑coded values in a contrived environment.
> 
> I appreciate the time your team invested, and I hope you find the candidate who fits what you're looking for. This process has at least helped me refine what I'm willing to entertain in the future.
> 
> Best regards,
> Candidate
